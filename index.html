                                        <h4>Circa December 6, 2019</h4>
                                        <p>I decided to make a personal website from scratch and switch over from Wordpress, which was
                                                costing me $$ and not very personalized. I thought it would be a good investment to
                                                learn a new skill and would look nicer. I'm so glad I decided to do it. A few weeks later
                                                my friend Amy convinced me to take MIT Web Lab, a 3 week crash course where you build a full
                                                stack web app and participate in a competition. It was SO hard and I wanted to quit at
                                                the beginning, since I had almost no coding experience. But we stuck it out and made it
                                                to semi-finals with our <a href="https://stanza-poetry.herokuapp.com/">computational poetry generator</a>
                                                called Stanza.

                                        <p>I joined the mechanical analysis team and designed/tested/analyzed camera mounts and acoustics
                                                for the autonomous cars. Learned a ton about vibrational analysis and got a lot of CAD

                                        <p>We drove 1700 miles along the Oregon Trail, in addition to a few hundred miles in a grand prix.
                                                I was a driver because I was small enough to fit in the tiny driver pod.
                                                Notable moments include: spinning out on the test track and getting an donut award for 'attempting
                                                circular motion', seeing a meteor shower at Craters of the Moon National Park,
                                                getting hilarious looks from unknowing passersby, being told I was 'so smart for a girl',
                                                and crossing the finish line in 5th place! </br>

                                                I became the captain and traveled around with my team competing in national tournaments.
                                                It was way more exciting than classes.
                                                I also spent some time on the swim team and then the Milwaukee Rowing Club team.
