                                        <img src=""/>
                                        <p>After deciding to pursue an engineering career path, I knew I had to pull the plug and work directly on
                                        sustainability. For years, I have applied to many positions and learned it's not an easy field to enter.
                                        Exciting, innovative technology startups have a high bar for talent, and I've been told
                                        many times that I would need a PhD. </br></br>
                                        But if I've learned anything over my lifetime, it's that perseverance works wonders. I cold emailed. I zoomed.
                                        I spoke with my professors, friends, and over 20 companies, searching for a small startup, doing impactful work
                                        furthering sustainability, with interesting hardware, where I could learn and grow as an engineer. </br></br>
                                        After a few months of focused effort, I found exactly what I was looking for at Treau, a seed stage startup working on
                                        sustainable building heating and cooling. They have a small but mighty team, and everything about Treau told me I had to
                                        join it. I am so happy to finally have clarity and be following my heart.

                                        <h3>Officially paused Nibble and reflected on my goals, career, and education</h3>
                                        <h4>September 1, 2020</h4>
                                        <img src=""/>
                                        <p>After building Nibble and deciding to pause it in August, I spent some time reflecting on my career
                                                and life goals. I concluded that:</br>
                                                <ol style="font-size: 11pt;">
                                                <li>I prefer technical work to nontechnical work</li>
                                                <li>I prefer to work on hardware and innovative technology as opposed to logistics or pure software</li>
                                                <li>I want to have a part in developing innovative climate tech, whether or not I am the founder</li>
                                                <li>I probably still want to start a company at some point, but my immediate priority is becoming a better engineer
                                                        and learning technical skills so that I can work on hard tech</li>
                                                </ol>
                                        <p>
                                        I also realized my previous lack of commitment to an engineering career path stemmed from insecurity in my technical
                                        abilities. These insecurities are rooted in specific instances in my education,
                                        such as failing to finish math tests in the allotted time in middle and high school, getting a B on my high school trig
                                        test, being one of a handful of women in my high school math, physics and engineering classes, doing most poorly on the math
                                        section of standardized tests, and struggling in my math classes at MIT.
                                        </br></br>
                                        These repeated instances of feeling like I was underperforming, coupled with external reinforcement that women aren't as good
                                        at math, have led me to the assumption that 'I am bad at math' and that 'I hate math.' The truth is
                                        that I am far above average in my mathematical thinking, and that I love
                                        and appreciate the way that math allows us to model the world and solve problems. I think a big reason I have 'struggled' in
                                        math has nothing to do with my intelligence, but the arbitrary way in which our education system measures our math abilities.
                                        </br></br>
                                        I have never been <i>fast</i> at math. Therefore, I am bad at taking timed tests. Which our education system uses to
                                        assess our math abilities. I am not fast, because I triple check my work before I trust it. And given enough time, I will
                                        solve almost any problem. If anything, I think that makes me good at math, and well equipped to tackle technical challenges.

                                                Nibble is a marketplace for restaurant food that normally goes to waste. Restaurants throw away
                                                TONS of good food. It's hard to predict demand, so they tend to prepare more food than they can sell.
                                                At the end of the night, the extra food gets tossed. Nibble helps them save money by selling that food
                                                at a discount instead of throwing it away.

                                        <p>I decided to make a personal website from scratch and switch over from Wordpress, which was
                                                costing me $$ and not very personalized. I thought it would be a good investment to
                                                learn a new skill and would look nicer. I'm so glad I decided to do it. A few weeks later
                                                my friend Amy convinced me to take MIT Web Lab, a 3 week crash course where you build a full
                                                stack web app and participate in a competition. It was SO hard and I wanted to quit at
                                                the beginning, since I had almost no coding experience. But we stuck it out and made it
                                                to semi-finals with our <a href="https://stanza-poetry.herokuapp.com/">computational poetry generator</a>

                                        <p>I joined the mechanical analysis team and designed/tested/analyzed camera mounts and acoustics
                                                for the autonomous cars. Learned a ton about vibrational analysis and got a lot of CAD
                                                practice in Solidworks.</br></br>
                                                I was hopeful that a future with autonomous cars could improve

                                                hopeful that this is the future we  will actually arrive at. It would require complete
                                                adoption of autonomy, one system or company running everything, and a full conversion
                                                to electric vehicles. It may still be possible, but is far off in the future. Especially

                                        <p>With a small team of students, I helped developed a <a href="docs/bludartI.pdf">solar</a> powered drone prototype in
                                                order to improve surveillance of the Amazon rainforest and track deforestation. We
                                                met with our partner, Conservation International, in Lima, and then traveled to
                                                two rainforest research stations - Villa Carman and Wayquecha - where we tested
                                                our drone. The rainforest is absolutely breathtaking. I was so sad to learn
                                                that much of the deforestation is driven by poverty. People in need of income
                                                cut down small swathes of rainforest in order to start farms, and it's nearly impossible
                                                to detect using satellite images.

                                           devices humans have ever built? The detectors pick up the gravitational pull when

                                        <p>In World Taekwondo Federation collegiate sparring matches, teams consist of a heavy, medium, and lightweight
                                        competitor, divided into belt categories A, B, and C. I was the lightweight competitor on MIT's C1 team.
                                        In order to win a match, your team must win 2/3 of weight category pairings. Less than 3 fights occur
                                        when one team lacks a third member, or if one team wins the first 2 matches. Due to these rules, most
                                        competitors sit out for several matches. At this tournament however, all teams had a lightweight competitor,
                                        and I fought every single match. Because I was undefeated, my teammates sat out several
                                        matches each. Let's just say it was an exhausting day full of bruising, but extremely fun and well worth the reward!
