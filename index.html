                                                Nibble is a marketplace for restaurant food that normally goes to waste. Restaurants throw away
                                                TONS of good food. It's hard to predict demand, so they tend to prepare more food than they can sell.
                                                At the end of the night, the extra food gets tossed. Nibble helps them save money by selling that food
                                                at a discount instead of throwing it away.

                                        <p>I decided to make a personal website from scratch and switch over from Wordpress, which was
                                                costing me $$ and not very personalized. I thought it would be a good investment to
                                                learn a new skill and would look nicer. I'm so glad I decided to do it. A few weeks later
                                                my friend Amy convinced me to take MIT Web Lab, a 3 week crash course where you build a full
                                                stack web app and participate in a competition. It was SO hard and I wanted to quit at
                                                the beginning, since I had almost no coding experience. But we stuck it out and made it
                                                to semi-finals with our <a href="https://stanza-poetry.herokuapp.com/">computational poetry generator</a>

                                        <p>I joined the mechanical analysis team and designed/tested/analyzed camera mounts and acoustics
                                                for the autonomous cars. Learned a ton about vibrational analysis and got a lot of CAD
                                                practice in Solidworks.</br></br>
                                                I was hopeful that a future with autonomous cars could improve
                                                our society's efficiency and emissions. After learning more about the space, I am less
                                                hopeful that this is the future we  will actually arrive at. It would require complete
                                                adoption of autonomy, one system or company running everything, and a full conversion

                                        <p>With a small team of students, I helped developed a solar powered drone prototype in
                                                order to improve surveillance of the Amazon rainforest and track deforestation. We
                                                met with our partner, Conservation International, in Lima, and then traveled to
                                                two rainforest research stations - Villa Carman and Wayquecha - where we tested
                                                our drone. The rainforest is absolutely breathtaking. I was so sad to learn
                                                that much of the deforestation is driven by poverty. People in need of income
                                                cut down small swathes of rainforest in order to start farms, and it's nearly impossible
                                                to detect or prevent.

                                        <p>We drove 1700 miles along the Oregon Trail, in addition to a few hundred miles in a grand prix.
                                                I was a driver because I was small enough to fit in the tiny driver pod.
                                                Notable moments include: spinning out on the test track and getting an donut award for 'attempting
                                                circular motion', seeing a meteor shower at Craters of the Moon National Park,
                                                getting hilarious looks from unknowing passersby, being told I was 'so smart for a girl',
                                                and crossing the finish line in 5th place! </br>

                                        <p>Stayed in Benevento for the month while learning about gravitational wave
                                           detector physics, specifically focusing on thermal noise within the Virgo and LIGO
                                           interferometer mirrors. Did you know these detectors are the most sensitive measurement
                                           devices humans have ever built? The detectors pick up the gravitational pull when
                                           nearby trees sway in the wind, so the trees around the detectors are
                                           cleared just to make the signal less noisy!

                                        <p>Spent most of my time doing Lincoln-Douglas Debate instead of assignments and studying.
                                                I became the captain and traveled around with my team competing in national tournaments.
                                                It was way more exciting than classes.
                                                I also spent some time on the swim team and then the Milwaukee Rowing Club team.
