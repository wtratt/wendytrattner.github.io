    <div class="about_story_container">
      <p>I grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and lived with various guardians for most of my childhood. In middle school, I
        spent my time reading books and thinking about what I needed to do in order to find happiness. I found myself drawn
        to many topics in science, including cellular biology, black holes, and climate change.
      </p>

      <p>In high school, I became a competitive Lincoln-Douglas debater, and was introduced to a
        large variety of issues in philosophy, law, policy, medicine, technology, and the environment. Toward the end of
        high school, I developed a desire for hands-on learning and wanted to apply my knowledge meaningfully, so I found a way
        to intern at MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research.
      </p>

      <p>My love of science eventually brought me to MIT as an undergraduate, where I've been exploring my many interests.
        I learned that even with no prior experience, I could learn to build useful things, and I declared mechanical
        engineering as my major. Since coming to MIT, Iâ€™ve studied gravitational wave detector materials in a physics lab in
        Italy, built a solar powered drone for rainforest conservation in Peru, and driven a solar powered car 1700 miles in
        the American Solar Challenge.
      </p>

      <p>In my free time, I enjoy painting, writing poetry, reading, ice skating, rock climbing, meeting people, and learning
        about the world. I seek to apply my interests in technology and science to help society become more sustainable,
        and I hope to continue to learn and grow on this mission.
