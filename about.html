    <div class="about_story_container">
      <p>I grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. When I turned 7, my mother died, and I was sent to live with various guardians
        throughout the rest of my childhood. I learned to take care of myself, and spent my time reading books and thinking
        about what I needed to do in order to find happiness. During middle school, I found myself drawn to many topics in
        science, including cellular biology, black holes, and climate change.
      </p>
      <p>In high school, I became a varsity Lincoln-Douglas debater, swimmer, and rower. I worked at a local retail store,
        and found a way to intern for a summer at MIT's cancer research institute.

      </p>
      <p>My love of science eventually brought me to MIT as an undergraduate, where I've been exploring my many interests.
        I learned that even with no prior experience, I could be an engineer and build useful things, so I declared mechanical
        engineering as my major. Since coming to MIT, Iâ€™ve studied gravitational wave detector materials in a physics lab in
        Italy, built a solar powered drone for rainforest conservation in Peru, and driven a solar powered car 1700 miles in
        the American Solar Challenge.
      </p>

      <p>In my free time, I enjoy painting, writing poetry, reading, ice skating, rock climbing, meeting people, and learning
        about the world. I seek to apply my interests in technology and science to help society become more sustainable,
        and I hope to continue to learn and grow on this mission.
