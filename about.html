                <div style="width:70%; margin:auto;">
                    <p>I grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and lived with various guardians for most of my childhood. In middle school, I
                        spent my time reading books and thinking about what I needed to do in order to find happiness. I found myself drawn
                        to many topics in science, including cellular biology, black holes, and climate change.
                    </p>

                    <p>In high school, I became a competitive Lincoln-Douglas debater, and was introduced to a
                    large variety of issues in philosophy, law, policy, medicine, technology, and the environment. Toward the end of
                    high school, I developed a desire for hands-on learning and wanted to apply my knowledge meaningfully, so I found a way
                    to intern at MIT's Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research.
                    </p>

                    <p>My love of science eventually brought me to MIT as an undergraduate, where I've been exploring my many interests.
                    I learned that even with no prior experience, I could learn to build useful things, and I declared mechanical
                    engineering as my major. Since coming to MIT, Iâ€™ve studied gravitational wave detector materials in a physics lab in
                    Italy, built a solar powered drone for rainforest conservation in Peru, and driven a solar powered car 1700 miles in
                    the American Solar Challenge.
                    </p>

                    <p>In my free time, I enjoy painting, writing poetry, reading, ice skating, rock climbing, meeting people, and learning
                    about the world. I seek to apply my interests in technology and science to help society become more sustainable,
                    and I hope to continue to learn and grow on this mission.
                    </p>
