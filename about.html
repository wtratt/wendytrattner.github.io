    <div class="about_story_container">
      <p>I have an immense drive to make an impact and a desire for constant self improvement.
        But how did I become this way?
      </p>
      <p>I grew up in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. When I turned 7, my mother died, and I spent the next chapter of my life living
        with various aunts and uncles, some of whom did not treat me kindly. As a result, I largely took care of myself.
        In middle school, I spent my time reading books, learning about interesting topics in science, and thinking about
        what I needed to do in order to find happiness.
      </p>
      <p>In high school, I learned to take advantage of opportunities and become a self-sufficient adult. I became a varsity
        Lincoln-Douglas debater and rower, and interned at MIT's cancer research institute in the summer. I took control of
        my finances and legal matters.

      </p>
      <p>My love of science eventually brought me to MIT as an undergraduate, where I've been exploring my many interests.
        Iâ€™ve studied gravitational wave detector materials in a physics lab in Italy, built a solar powered drone for
        rainforest conservation in Peru, and helped drive a solar powered car 1700 miles in the American Solar Challenge.
        I learned that I could be an engineer and build useful things, even with no prior experience. I declared mechanical
        engineering as my major so that I could continue to build cool and useful things.
      </p>

      <p>Throughout my entire life, I've had to be completely self-motivated. Through my own experience of what can be
        accomplished through pure determination, I've developed high standards and ambitions for myself. I believe that I
        can create meaning for myself by contributing to the betterment of society, and I hope to continue to learn and grow on this mission.
      </p>
